# GoLogger
This project implements a custom logging solution in Go (version 1.22) designed to provide fine-grained control over log levels and output. The logger supports six log levels: Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error, and Fatal, each serving a specific purpose in diagnosing and monitoring the application's behavior.
